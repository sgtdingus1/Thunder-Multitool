# Thunder-Multitool

This tool only works on Windows operating systems!

Howdy, I made the Thunder Multitool for fun and to fuck with my buddies on Discord!  It is completely open source!  

Run these commands in your command prompt and it should run smoothly!  

```pip install requests cryptography psutil speedtest-cli```
